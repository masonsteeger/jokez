# Jokez

## Explanation
A joke app where users can submit jokes to our database, pull a random joke from the database, and vote on whether or not they think the joke is funny with up/down votes. Be sure that its a funny joke when you submit because jokes with less than -10 votes will get deleted from the database!!

## Technologies Used
The app was built using React for the frontend with a PHP backend and Postgres for the database storage. Using PHP and Postgres requests we are able to populate jokes on the Library and sort them using different parameters with .map and .filter and setting them to display none or display block depending on what the user clicks. The same display none/display block method was used to switch our pages using the nav bar on the left side of the page.


## Unsolved Problems
I would like to eventually add user authentication and change the voting system to where users are only allowed to vote on a joke once
